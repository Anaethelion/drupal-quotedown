 * *ception here would cause the size to drop down until it reaches
 * less than 6px; Once you reach this size most browsers will drop the
 * size to 0px which will hide the text and allow the user to put non
 * visible content, such as either one of viagra advertisement or
 * malicious code in a code block area (copy/paste attack). This one
 * liner will avoid text to be hidden and fix this.
